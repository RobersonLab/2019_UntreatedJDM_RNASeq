# 2019 Untreated JDM / secondary autoimmune disease RNA-Seq

This project used PBMCs from controls, individuals with Juvenile Dermatomyositis (JDM), and some of the same patients when they were clinically inactive. A second involved cohort involved individuals with treatment-responsive JDM and later when they developed psoriasis. We used ribosomal depletion RNA-Seq to analyze the difference amongst groups. This repository contains the code to download the associated on FigShare and run the analysis in R Studio using Knitr.
